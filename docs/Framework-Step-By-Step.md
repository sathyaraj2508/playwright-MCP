Framework
Step-By-Step Guide
Building a Test Automation Framework with Playwright and
TypeScript

## Introduction

This guide walks you step by step through setting up a complete automated testing framework using
Playwright and TypeScript, and using an AI coding agent to help generate configuration, utilities, and
tests. It uses a demo project called Playwright_opencart_MCP as the running example, but the same
approach can be adapted to other projects.
The original instructions, commands, configuration values, and overall flow from the source document
are preserved. The AI prompts have been refined for clarity, consistency, and better results when used
with an AI coding agent.

## How to Read This Document

PROMPT sections contain text you can copy and paste into your AI coding agent, such as Claude
Code, GitHub Copilot, CommandCode, or OpenCode.
Code sections contain file contents or commands that you type or paste directly into your project.

> **Note sections call out important warnings or clarifications.**

> **Why this matters sections explain the purpose behind a step so you understand not only how to do**

it, but why it is needed.

## Glossary: Key Terms Used in This Guide

If you're new to test automation, skim this section first. You can always come back to it as terms come up
later in the guide.
Term What it means
Node.js A program that lets you run JavaScript/TypeScript code outside a web browser. It is
required to install and run Playwright.
npm “Node Package Manager.” The tool installed together with Node.js that is used to
download and install code libraries, such as the ones used in this framework.
Playwright An open-source tool by Microsoft that automates web browsers — it can open pages, click
buttons, fill forms, and check results, which is exactly what automated tests need to do.
TypeScript A version of JavaScript that adds type checking, which helps catch mistakes before you
run your code. Playwright supports writing tests in TypeScript or plain JavaScript; this
guide uses TypeScript.
VS Code Visual Studio Code — a free, popular code editor used to write and run the project files in
this guide.
Coding agent / AI
agent
An AI assistant, such as Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, CommandCode, or OpenCode,
that can write or edit code when you give it a written instruction (a “prompt”).
Prompt The instructions you type or paste to an AI coding agent describing what you want it to
build or change.
Page Object
Model (POM)
A common way of organizing test code where each web page, such as Login or Cart, has
its own file describing how to interact with it. These files live in the pages/ folder.
Fixtures Reusable setup and clean-up code that multiple tests can share, for example logging in
before a test starts. These live in the fixtures/ folder.
Allure Report A tool that turns raw test results into an easy-to-read HTML report with charts, history,
and screenshots.
CI/CD “Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment” — automatically building and
testing your code whenever it changes, typically using tools like GitHub Actions or
Jenkins.
MCP (Model
Context Protocol)
A way for AI agents to directly use tools such as a web browser through Playwright,
allowing the AI to interact with a real page while generating tests.
Docker A tool that packages your project and everything it needs to run into a portable
“container,” so it behaves consistently across environments.
.env file A plain-text file that stores configuration values and settings, such as URLs and test
credentials, separately from your code.
.gitignore A file that tells Git which files or folders to exclude from version control, such as node_m
odules or generated reports.

## Prerequisites (Manual Actions/Steps)

Before you start building the framework, install the following tools on your computer. Each one plays a
specific role in the setup.
Install
1. Node.js (latest) — https://nodejs.org/en — required to run Playwright and npm commands.
2. Visual Studio Code (latest) — https://code.visualstudio.com/ — the code editor you'll use
throughout this guide.
3. Coding Agent — Claude Code / GitHub Copilot / CommandCode / OpenCode or any other AI
coding agent. This is the AI assistant that will generate files for you whenever a step includes a
prompt.

> **Why this matters: Node.js is the engine that runs everything else in this guide, VS Code is where**

you'll view and edit files, and the coding agent is what turns the written prompts into real code.
Install Playwright Using the VS Code Terminal
Open a terminal inside VS Code:
Terminal → New Terminal
Run:
npm init playwright@latest
This command downloads Playwright and walks you through a short setup wizard.
Choose the following options when prompted:
1. Do you want to use TypeScript or JavaScript? → TypeScript
2. Where to put your end-to-end tests? → tests
3. Add a GitHub Actions workflow? (Y/n) → true
4. Install Playwright browsers? → true

> **Why this matters: This wizard creates the basic Playwright project skeleton for you — the**

config file, an example test, and, if selected, a ready-made GitHub Actions workflow file — so you
don't have to build it from scratch.
Install Other Dependencies
Create a file named env_setup.bat in the project root.
This file contains the commands below so anyone on the team can install the required dependencies in
one go instead of typing each command separately.
Commands — place inside env_setup.bat
npm install dotenv
npm install @faker-js/faker
npm install luxon
npm install ajv csv-parse xlsx
npm install @axe-core/playwright
npm install allure-playwright
npm install -D @types/node
npx playwright install
npm install mysql2

## Quick Reference — What Each Package Is For

1. dotenv — loads settings from your .env file into your code.
2. @faker-js/faker — generates realistic fake test data such as names, emails, and addresses.
3. luxon — handles dates and times.
4. ajv, csv-parse, xlsx — validate JSON data and read CSV/Excel test-data files.
5. @axe-core/playwright — adds accessibility checks to your tests.
6. allure-playwright — produces the Allure report used later in this guide.
7. @types/node — gives TypeScript awareness of Node.js built-in features.
8. playwright install — downloads the actual browsers Playwright will control.
9. mysql2 — lets your tests connect to a MySQL database.
Run the env_setup.bat file from the terminal.

> **Note: You only need to run env_setup.bat once per machine, or again later if new**

dependencies are added to the list.

## Step by Step: Building the Framework

With the prerequisites installed, follow these 13 steps in order.
Steps marked Manual are performed by you.
Steps marked Using Prompt can be handed to your AI coding agent.

## Step 1 — Create the Project Folder Structure

Manual or Using Prompt

> **Why this matters: A consistent folder structure keeps configuration, test data, page objects, and**

reports separated and easy to find as the project grows.

### PROMPT — Copy/Paste This to Your AI Coding Agent

Create the required folder and file structure for the project root `Playwright_opencart_MCP
`.
Use the target structure shown in the supplied project context/document.
Requirements:
- Create only the required folders and placeholder files.
- Preserve all existing project files unless they must be created or updated.
- Do not delete or overwrite existing implementation files unnecessarily.
- Keep the structure organized for Playwright + TypeScript automation covering Web, A
PI, and DB testing.
- Use the existing project naming conventions.
- After creating the structure, show the final directory tree and briefly identify an
y files that were newly created.
Target structure:
Playwright_opencart_MCP/
├── .env
├── .gitignore
├── api/
│ ├── endpoints/
│ └── schemas/
├── custom-report/
├── fixtures/
├── pages/
├── prompts/
├── tests/
│ ├── web/
│ ├── api/
│ └── db/
├── testdata/
├── utils/
├── reports/

## Step 2 — Add or Update Configuration Files

Manual
Three configuration files control how the framework behaves:
playwright.config.ts — Playwright test-runner settings
tsconfig.json — TypeScript settings
.env — environment values and secrets
Create or update the following configuration files in the project:
- playwright.config.ts
- tsconfig.json
- .env

> **Note: Use the exact configuration values and settings provided in this guide.**

playwright.config.ts
This file tells Playwright how to run your tests — timeouts, browsers, retries, reporters, traces,
screenshots, videos, and other execution settings.
import { defineConfig, devices } from "@playwright/test";
export default defineConfig({
timeout: 30 * 1000, //30000 ms(30 secs)
testDir: "./tests",
fullyParallel: true,
retries: process.env.CI ? 2 : 0,
workers: process.env.CI ? 1 : undefined,
reporter: [
["list"], // Detailed console output
//['line'], // One-line progress output
//['dot'], // Minimal console output
["html", { open: "never", outputFolder: "reports" }], // HTML Report
//['json', { outputFile: 'reports/results.json' }], // JSON Report
["junit", { outputFile: "reports/results.xml" }], // JUnit XML Report
["./utils/CustomReporter.ts"], // Custom reporter
["allure-playwright", { outputFolder: "allure-results" }], // Allure Report
],
use: {
trace: "on-first-retry",
screenshot: "only-on-failure",
video: "retain-on-failure",
headless: false,
viewport: { width: 1280, height: 720 }, // Set default viewport size for consiste
ncy
ignoreHTTPSErrors: true, // Ignore SSL errors if necessary
permissions: ["geolocation"], // Set necessary permissions for geolocation-based
tests
},
grep: /@master/,
projects: [
{
name: "chromium",
use: { ...devices["Desktop Chrome"] },
},
/*
{
name: 'firefox',
use: { ...devices['Desktop Firefox'] },
},
{
name: 'webkit',
use: { ...devices['Desktop Safari'] },
}
*/
],
});
tsconfig.json
This file configures how TypeScript compiles your code and defines shortcut import paths such as @util
s/ and @pages/.
{
"compilerOptions": {
"target": "ES2022",
"module": "Node16",
"lib": ["ES2022", "DOM"],
"moduleResolution": "node16",
"types": ["node"],
"strict": true,
"esModuleInterop": true,
"skipLibCheck": true,
"forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
"resolveJsonModule": true,
"isolatedModules": false,
"outDir": "dist",
"ignoreDeprecations": "6.0"
},
"include": ["playwright.config.ts"],
"exclude": ["node_modules"]
}
.env
This file stores URLs, login credentials, and other settings your tests need separately from your code.

ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin
⚠ Important For your project, keep the actual .env file in .gitignore because it contains
credentials. And keep only placeholder values in .env.example

## Step 3 — Add Test Data Files

Manually

> **Why this matters: Keeping test data, such as login credentials or product information, in**

separate files instead of hard-coding it into tests makes tests reusable and easy to update.
Place test data files inside the testdata/ folder.
testdata/
├── opencart_logindata.json
├── opencart_logindata.csv
└── opencart_logindata.xlsx

## Step 4 — Add API Endpoints and Schemas Under the api/

Folder
Manually

> **Why this matters: Separating API route definitions ( endpoints/) from the JSON “shapes” you**

expect responses to match ( schemas/) keeps API tests organized and makes it easy to validate
responses automatically.
api/
├── endpoints/
│ └── routes.ts # Centralized endpoint URL constants
└── schemas/
├── product_api_schema.json # JSON Schema for product responses
├── cart_api_schema.json # JSON Schema for cart responses
└── user_api_schema.json # JSON Schema for user responses

## Step 5 — Create the Custom Reporter and Place It in the util

s Folder
Manually

> **Why this matters: The custom reporter referenced in playwright.config.ts needs an actual**

file to run — this is where it lives.
utils/
└── CustomReporter.ts

## Step 6 — Place Prompt Files in the prompts Folder

Manually
These are the written instructions you will later provide to your AI coding agent in Step 8 to generate the
actual tests.
Add the following files:
1. opencart_web_test_prompts.md
2. fakestore_api_test_prompts.md
3. db_test_prompt.md
4. utilitis_prompt.md
promtps/
|── opencart_web_test_prompts.md
|── fakestore_api_test_prompts.md
|── db_test_prompt.md
└── utilitis_prompt.md

## Step 7 — Create Helper & Utility Files

Manually or Using Prompt

> **Why this matters: Helper and utility files, such as data readers, generators, DB clients, and**

common helpers, provide reusable building blocks that your tests and page objects can call instead
of repeating the same logic everywhere.
Supply the utilitis_prompt.md file to the AI agent and give it the prompt below.

### PROMPT — Copy/Paste This to Your AI Coding Agent

Read and follow all instructions in `prompts/utilitis_prompt.md`.
Create or update the required helper and utility files under the `utils/` folder.
Requirements:
- Follow every requirement defined in `utilitis_prompt.md`.
- Reuse existing utilities when appropriate instead of creating duplicate functionali
ty.
- Keep the implementation compatible with Playwright + TypeScript.
- Use the existing project structure, aliases, naming conventions, and dependencies.
- Do not modify unrelated files.
- Do not create unnecessary utilities.
- If a required utility already exists, update it only when necessary.
- After implementation, list the utility files created or updated and briefly explain
their purpose.
utils/
└── dataGenerator.ts
└── DataReader.ts
└── dbClient.ts
└── helper.ts

## Step 8 — Generate Tests Using the Prompts Stored in the prom

pts Folder
You can give the AI coding agent each prompt one at a time, or all of them at once.

> **Note: Make sure you have installed Playwright MCP or the Playwright CLI before**

proceeding further. Clearly state in the prompt which mechanism the agent should use: MCP or
CLI.
Refer to the Playwright CLI Documentation: https://playwright.dev/agent-cli/introduction

## Installation instructions: https://playwright.dev/agent-cli/installation

# Installation
npm install -g @playwright/cli@latest
playwright-cli install
playwright-cli install --skills
# Verify
playwright-cli --version
Attach playwright_mcp_context.md, then provide the test prompts from the following files:
1. opencart_web_test_prompts.md
2. fakestore_api_test_prompts.md
3. db_test_prompt.md

### Prompt 1 — Web

### PROMPT — Copy/Paste This to Your AI Coding Agent

Use the supplied Playwright MCP/CLI setup and the attached `playwright_mcp_context.md`
as the implementation context.
Read and follow the web test requirements in `prompts/opencart_web_test_prompts.md`.
Generate the required Playwright + TypeScript web tests.
Requirements:
- Follow the supplied test prompt exactly.
- Use Playwright MCP or Playwright CLI as specified for this task.
- Inspect the application when browser interaction is required.
- Follow the framework structure and conventions defined in the supplied context.
- Use Page Object Model and fixtures where required by the framework/context.
- Reuse existing utilities, test data, configuration, and fixtures whenever applicabl
e.
- Do not duplicate existing framework functionality.
- Do not modify unrelated files.
- Add appropriate test tags and assertions based on the supplied test requirements.
- Keep tests maintainable, readable, and suitable for repeated execution.
- After implementation, list the files created or updated and explain what was implem
ented.

### Prompt 2 — API

### PROMPT — Copy/Paste This to Your AI Coding Agent

Use the supplied Playwright MCP/CLI setup and the attached `playwright_mcp_context.md`
as the implementation context.
Read and follow the API test requirements in `prompts/fakestore_api_test_prompts.md`.
Generate the required Playwright + TypeScript API tests.
Requirements:
- Follow the supplied test prompt exactly.
- Use the existing API configuration, endpoint definitions, schemas, utilities, and f
ixtures where applicable.
- Reuse existing framework components instead of duplicating functionality.
- Validate HTTP status codes, response data, and schemas wherever required by the sup
plied test prompt.
- Keep API tests independent unless the supplied test requirements explicitly define
a dependency or sequence.
- Do not hard-code environment-specific values that belong in `.env` or test-data fil
es.
- Do not modify unrelated files.
- Add appropriate test tags.
- After implementation, list the files created or updated and briefly explain the API
coverage implemented.

### Prompt 3 — DB

### PROMPT — Copy/Paste This to Your AI Coding Agent

Use the supplied Playwright MCP/CLI setup and the attached `playwright_mcp_context.md`
as the implementation context.
Read and follow the database test requirements in `prompts/db_test_prompt.md`.
Generate the required Playwright + TypeScript database tests.
Requirements:
- Follow the supplied database test prompt exactly.
- Use the project's existing DB configuration and `mysql2`-based database utilities w
here applicable.
- Reuse existing DB client/helper functionality instead of creating duplicate impleme
ntations.
- Keep database credentials and environment-specific values in `.env`.
- Validate the database results required by the supplied test prompt.
- Ensure database connections are properly handled and released.
- Do not modify unrelated files.
- Add appropriate test tags.
- After implementation, list the files created or updated and briefly explain the dat
abase coverage implemented.

> **Note: Page Object classes ( pages/) and fixtures ( fixtures/) are not created manually — the**

coding agent generates them automatically as it builds each test, based on the context supplied in
playwright_mcp_context.md.

## Step 9 — Update package.json With Custom Test Commands

Manually

> **Why this matters: Custom npm scripts let you or your CI pipeline run a specific group of tests**

— such as only @sanity tests — with one short command instead of typing the full Playwright
command every time.
Update package.json to add the following custom scripts for running tagged test suites:
"scripts": {
"test:api": "playwright test --grep @api",
"test:web": "playwright test --grep @web",
"test:master": "playwright test --grep @master",
"test:sanity": "playwright test --grep @sanity",
"test:regression": "playwright test --grep @regression",
"test:e2e": "playwright test --grep @e2e",
"test:datadriven": "playwright test --grep @datadriven",
"test:master:headed": "playwright test --grep @sanity --headed",
"test:sanity:debug": "playwright test --grep @sanity --debug"
}
Example Commands to Run the Tests
Command Description
npm run test:api Run tests tagged with @api
npm run test:web Run tests tagged with @web
npm run test:master Run tests tagged with @master
npm run test:sanity Run tests tagged with @sanity
npm run test:regression Run tests tagged with @regression
npm run test:e2e Run tests tagged with @e2e
npm run test:datadriven Run tests tagged with @datadriven
npm run test:master:headed Run tests taggedwith @master in headed mode
npm run test:sanity:debug Run tests tagged with @sanity in debug mode

## Run the Tests

npm run test:master

## Generate and View the Allure Report

The Allure reporter was registered in playwright.config.ts in Step 2.
allure generate ./allure-results -o ./allure-report --clean
allure open ./allure-report

## Step 10 — Push the Project to GitHub

Using Prompt or Manually

## Git Workflow -Using git commands

The most commonly used commands are:
git init
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
git status
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git
git push -u origin master
git pull

### PROMPT — Copy/Paste This to Your AI Coding Agent

Add, commit, and push the latest project changes to the configured GitHub repository.
Follow these steps:
1. Review the current Git status and identify all project changes.
2. Ensure appropriate files are staged. Do not commit secrets, `.env` files, generate
d files, dependencies, or other files excluded by `.gitignore`.
3. Stage the required changes.
4. Create a clear and descriptive commit message based on the actual changes.
5. Commit the changes to the current branch.
6. Push the commit to the configured GitHub remote repository.
7. If there are no changes to commit, do not create an empty commit. Report that the
working tree is clean.
8. If the push fails, report the exact reason and do not claim that the push was succ
essful.
After completion, report:
Commit message,Branch,Push result (Successful or Failed or No changes to push)

## CI / CD (Continuous Integration & Delivery)

## Step 11 — Playwright GitHub Actions Workflow

Manually

> **Why this matters: A GitHub Actions workflow automatically runs your tests, for example on**

every push or pull request, and stores the resulting reports without anyone needing to run them
manually.
